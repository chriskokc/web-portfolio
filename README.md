# Welcome to Chris Ko's Web Portfolio

This is my personal webpage showing my coding projects' portfolio. 



Here is the header part of my webpage:

I built my webpage following this sequence: structure, styling and then JavaScript functionalities.

For the portfolio part, I applied Flexbox to layout my projects, and they can wrap to different sizes when the screen changes from desktop, tablet to mobile.

For the profile section, I used the Grid layout system in my media queries, and the profile image can stretch to the right on a tablet and desktop view. <img width="100" alt="profile" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87203804/176224991-e621a929-8df8-41f5-9db5-5efd7bcf01d9.png">

Some online resources like W3School and stackoverflow have been used a reference to implement the dropdown menu functionaly in the resume section:<img width="1000" alt="toggle" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87203804/176225319-db6d11a7-d126-475d-893e-ff39d318883e.png">
