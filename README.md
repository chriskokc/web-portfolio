# Welcome to Chris Ko's Web Portfolio

This is my personal webpage showing my coding projects' portfolio. 



Here is the header part of my webpage:

I built my webpage following this sequence: structure, styling and then JavaScript functionalities.

For the portfolio part, I applied Flexbox to layout my projects, and they can wrap to different sizes when the screen changes from desktop, tablet to mobile.

For the profile section, I used the Grid layout system in my media queries, and the profile image can stretch to the right on a tablet and desktop view.

Some online resources like W3School and stackoverflow have been used a reference to implement the dropdown menu functionaly in the resume section:
